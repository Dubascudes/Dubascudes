        <h3 class="rainbow">About Me</h3>

            <p> Hello! My name is Will English, welcome to my website. I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 2001. I have lived in Florida since 2003.
              In 2013 I built my first personal computer after developing a fascination with technology. In 2015 I was diagnosed with Hodgkins Lymphoma, which sparked an
    interest in using computational methods for early diagnosis and generating efficient treatment plans. 
    I spent the my time in high school on building robots and teaching myself how to be a better programmer. I started my own robotics team,
    became an eagle scout, and now I'm pursuing my dream of studying computer science at UCF. Feel free to contact me with
    any questions, reference requests, or anything else you might need.</p>

         <h3 class="rainbow">Skills and Interests</h3>
        <p>Programming Languages: Java, C/C++, Python</p>
        <p>Hobbies: rock climbing, scuba diving, camping, hiking, robotics</p>
