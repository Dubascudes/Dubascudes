        <h3 class="rainbow">About Me</h3>
        <p>Hi, I'm Will English. I like programming things and making things work. Problem solving is my passion. 
          I was diagnosed with cancer when I was 14 and it made me realize the value of life, so I have been trying very hard to make use of my time.
           I hope to have a positive impact on a lot of people. </p>
    
         <h3 class="rainbow">Skills and Interests</h3>
        <p>Code: Java, C++, Python, CSS, HTML, JavaScript</p>
        <p>Other: rock climbing, scuba diving, camping/outdoorsman, electronics, sandwich maker (professional level), sandwich eating (amateur), boy scout</p>
        
        <h3 class="rainbow">Experiences \</h3>
       
       <p>Over the course of 2 weeks, I lead a crew on a 60 mile hike in Cimmarron, New Mexico. While on trail, we ascended to an elevation of 11605 feet.</p>
       <p> While in Quetico Provincial Park, Ontario, I lead a crew on an 9 day, 75 mile trek. During this trek, we paddled in canoe the majority of the way, and carried 100% of our food and gear into the park. No trace of our presence was left.</p>
    <p>I have also completed and logged 16 open water dives, in both fresh water springs and in the Florida Keys. </p>
    
    <p>I have built and operated 3 robots for competition during my time at Team 6468 Positronic Panthers for FRC. I also founded a new team, 7754, which scored highest rookie seed at the Orlando regional</p>
