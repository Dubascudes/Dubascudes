        <h3 class="rainbow">About Me</h3>

            <p> So here's what happened. So I was in Pittsburgh, right? I didn't really know anyone at the time so I was just crashing with some family. Anyways before I even remembered how to talk, I wound up in Jacksonville. After that I just sort of zoned out for like more than a decade. Then at some point I had chocolate pudding in a hospital cafeteria several times consecutively, and then I built multiple robots. I walked, canoed, and swam for literally miles. Then around the 9,820,800 minute mark I sort of remembered everything again. Email me!</p>

         <h3 class="rainbow">Skills and Interests</h3>
        <p>Programming Languages: Java, C/C++, Python</p>
        <p>Hobbies: rock climbing, scuba diving, camping, hiking, robotics</p>
