        <h3 class="rainbow">About Me</h3>

            <p> My name is Will English. I was born in Pittsburgh, PA (go Steelers). My dad moved us down to Jacksonville when I was
    2 and we've been in Florida ever since. When I was in 6th grade I took an interest in technology and ever since then I've
    been infatuated with machines and machine intelligence. In 9th grade I was diagnosed with Hodgkins Lymphoma which sparked an
    interest in using computational methods for early diagnosis and generating efficient treatment plans. After I beat cancer 
    I spent the rest of high school building robots and teaching myself how to be a better programmer. I started my own robotics team,
    became an eagle scout, and now I'm pursuing my dream of studying computer science at UCF (go Knights!) Feel free to contact me with
    any questions, reference requests, or anything else you might need. Cheers!</p>

         <h3 class="rainbow">Skills and Interests</h3>
        <p>Programming Languages: Java, C/C++, Python</p>
        <p>Hobbies: rock climbing, scuba diving, camping, hiking, robotics</p>
