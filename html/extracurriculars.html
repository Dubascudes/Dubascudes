     <h5>Fall, 2019 - Spring 2020</h5>
     <p> As a member of the UCF Climbing team, I spent 2-3 days per week during Fall and Spring semesters practicing rock climbing. This is a hobby of mine that I hope will continue the rest of my life. </p>
     <br>
     <h5>Summer, 2018:</h5>
     <p> While in Quetico Provincial Park, Ontario, I lead a crew on an 9 day, 75 mile trek. During this trek, we paddled in canoe the majority of the way, and carried 100% of our food and gear into the park. No trace of our presence was left.</p>
     <br>
     <h5>Summer, 2018:</h5>
     <p> I completed my Eagle project in May of 2018, and I was awarded the rank of Eagle scout that summer. For my project, I designed, raised funds for, and lead the construction of two agility courses for the St. Johns Country Pet center. This county program is a no-kill shelter, and is responsible for the care of many dogs. The purpose of this project was to give the dogs activities and challenges as an outlet for their energy, built up from being in a cage all day. This energy often times deters potential rescuers.</p>
     <br>
     <h5>Summer, 2017 - Present:</h5>
     <p> As a PADI registered open water diver, I have also completed and logged 16 open water dives in both fresh water springs and in the Florida Keys. </p>
     <br>
     <h5>Summer, 2016:</h5>
     <p> Over the course of 2 weeks, I lead a crew on a 60 mile hike in Cimmarron, New Mexico. While on trail, we ascended to an elevation of 11605 feet.</p>
     <br>
     <h5>Fall, 2015 - Spring, 2019:</h5>
     <p> I have built and operated 3 robots for competition during my time at Team 6468 Positronic Panthers for FRC. I also founded a new team, 7754, which scored highest rookie seed at the Orlando regional</p>
