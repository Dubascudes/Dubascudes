      <h5> Burger King </h5>
      <p>June 2017, March 2018</p>
      <p> In my Junior year of high school, I worked a job at Burger King. My goal was to earn some extra money for college, and to fund some side projects I wanted to work on. I worked at a cash register, at the drive through, in the kitchen, and in the lobby. My responsibilities included customer service, food preparation, sanitation, and cashiering.</p>

      <h5> Westminster St. Augustine </h5>
      <p>June 2019, August 2019</p>
      <p> I worked at Westminster St. Augustine retirement communities as a summer job between my senior year in high school, and my freshman year at UCF. I washed dishes for the kitchen, and assisted the chefs and hosts with anything they needed.</p>
